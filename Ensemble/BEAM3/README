This is a brief guide for using BEAM3 (Bayesian Epistatis Association Mapping). 

The program uses graphs to account for SNP linkage disequlibrium (LD), such that the SNPs 
and SNP-SNP interactions are directly associatied with the disease, not due to LD effects.

The program also constructs a disease graph. Each node in the disease graph contains one or multiple
SNPs. The SNPs in a node are affecting the disease together, but independently of SNPs not included in the node. 
Each edge in the disease graph indicates an "interaction" between two nodes. That is, the two sets of SNPs
in the two connected nodes are jointly affecting the disease. Here, "interaction" means the two sets of SNPs
are jointly associated with the disease, i.e., their joint contribution to disease risk is stronger than their 
marginal contribution individually. This should not be confused with interation versus main effects in a regression
model, where interaction means the additional effects on top of main effects. In another word, even if an 
edge is present between two nodes, the SNPs within each node could still have main effects.

This version of the software is compiled in linux, and has not been exhaustively tested on all kinds of linux systems.

This software currently only supports case control studies. A software supporting QTL studies will be
released later. In the meanwhile, if you have quantitative traits, you could partition the traits into two classes, 
and then treat the data as cases and controls. This may not be a bad idea at all.

If you need to run this software on Windows or Mac or any other systems, you'll need to recompile the source code, which
is available on my website. However, be sure to download the GNU Scientific Library too, as my code requires it.

This package contains the following files:
	BEAM3
	README.txt
	toydata.txt

[1. Installation]-----------------------------------------

Unzip all files into one folder. BEAM3 uses the GNU Scientific Library (GSL),
which has been built in the executables.
Run the program from command line by typing 

./BEAM3 [inputfile] -o [outname] [options]


[2. Input Data Format]-----------------------------------------

The inpute file contains the case-control genotype data. The program allows 2 or 3 allelic
markers, corresponding to phased SNP alleles or unphased genotypes, respectively. 
The alleles should be coded as 0, 1, 2, with 3 denoting missing alleles. It
doesn't matter which allele/genotype is coded by which integer, but have to
use 3 or larger numbers to denote missing alleles. Currently missing alleles are
imputed by rule of thumb at each SNP independently. You may use other imputation software
to impute missing genotypes before running BEAM3;

The first line of the input file should contain the disease status of each individual.
You should use 1 to denote patients and 0 to denote controls. However, start
the first line by "ID Chr Position ", for example, to denote 3 cases and 3
controls, input the following in the first line:

ID Chr Position 1 1 1 0 0 0

Starting from the second line of the input file, each line contains the genotype data
at one SNP for all individuals, separated by space. But again, start each
line with information about SNP_ID, chromosome, and position. For example: 

rs1021 chr5 110123456 1 0 3 0 2 2

This line specifies a SNP called "rs1021", at chr5:110123456, which has genotypes 
1, 0, and a missing value in three cases, and 0, 2, 2 in three controls, respectively.

Always use numerical values for chromosome numbers, such as chr23 for chrX.

Each column in the input file denote one individual, the disease 
status for each individual specified in the first line must match with the correponding 
column of genotypes in the remaining lines. 

SNPs should be sorted by their physical locations.

Please see the included "toydata.txt" for an example of the input file.

[3. Options]

There are a few options controlled by the users. 

"-filter k": This option tells the program to filter SNPs with too many missing genotypes (3%),
	     unbalanced missing between cases and controls, and SNPs violating HWE.
	     If this option is used, the user must specify the value k. k=0 if heterozygote is
	     coded as 2, and k=1 if heterozygote is coded as 1.

"-sample burnin mcmc": This option specifies the numbers of burnin and sampling iteractions.
	     By default, burnin=mcmc=100. In each iteration, the program updates all variables once,
	     and thus these numbers do not necessarily relate with the number of SNPs. A few
	     hundreds iterations will be enough for most cases.

"-prior p": This option specifies how likely each SNP is associated with the disease.
	    By default, p=5/L, i.e., 5 associated SNPs are expected (of L SNPs).

"-T t":   This option tells the program to start running MCMC at a high temperature t, and the
	  temperature drops to 1 gradually over iterations. This option helps the program to jump
	  out of local modes in the first few iterations. However, this option can make the program
	  very slow in the first few iterations, because many SNPs will be included in calculation
	  when at high temporature.

[4. Output]-----------------------------------------

BEAM3 outputs 3 files, posterior.[outname] g.[outname].dot chi.txt

posterior.[outname] contains the posterior probabilities of marginal and interaction associations per SNP.
The content of the file almost is self explainary, where 0.01 + 0.10 = 0.11 means that the marginal
association probability at this SNP is 0.1, and the interaction association at this SNP is 0.10, and
the total disease association at this SNP is 0.11. You could also sum the probabilities of multiple SNPs
in a region to estimate the number of disease associated SNPs in the region. For example, if there 
are 100 SNPs spanning a 1Mb region, by summing the posterior probabilities (marginal, interaction,
or total) of the 100 SNPs, you could obtain an estimated number of disease SNPs in this region.

g.[outname].dot contains the disease graph. You can use GraphViz, a free software for graph visulization,
to visualize the disease graph. The first few lines in the file define graph nodes, and the numbers in
the parenthesis denotes the posterior probability of association of the node (summed over 100kb region).
The last few lines in the file define edges.

chi.txt is a chisq single-SNP test file, with test statistics and allele counts listed. This is for 
comparison purpose, not a necessary result from BEAM3.
