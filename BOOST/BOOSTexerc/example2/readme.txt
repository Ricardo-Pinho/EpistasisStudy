We provide a simple example to show how to use our code.
This example shows how to use our code to analyze multiple data sets from different chromosomes.

simdata1.txt contains 601 columns

y x1 x2... x600

simdata2.txt contains 401 columns

y x601 ... x1000


Notice that y must be the same, i.e., the first column of "simdata1.txt" and "simdata2.txt" should
be the same.


we only need specify its name in filenamelist: 
simdata1.txt
simdata2.txt
and then run the our exe file.


simdata1.txt and simdata2.txt is obtained by seperating simdata.txt in the example1, so the result is
same with example1.
